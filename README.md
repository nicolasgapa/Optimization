Linear programming optimization techniques

The primal and dual simplex algorithms are techniques to solve linear programming (optimization) problems. 
These methods are also useful for sensitivity analysis. 

The primal method is used to reach optimality starting from a basic feasible solution, while the dual simplex method is used to reach feasibility starting with an infeasible solution. 

In order to use the algorithms, edit the inputs section at the beginning of the code, where the following four variables have to be defined:
